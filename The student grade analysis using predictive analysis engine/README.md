## The student grade predictive analysis project

This project was started to build a prototype using the Predictive Analytics Engine.
It demonstrates how to predict student performance (e.g., final exam scores) based on various factors such as study hours, previous grades, and absences, 
using a publicly available student performance dataset. 
This example utilizes a simple linear regression model and provides a basic visualization of predicted vs. actual grades.
